# Embedded Android Summer School (AOSP + RPi)

Welcome to the Embedded Android Summer School!

This repository contains the resources & documentation materials for a workshop
about building & customizing AOSP on a Raspberry PI 5 (with Touch Display).

Please note that a powerful machine with at least 8vCPUs, 64GB RAM and 300GB
free space is required to build vanilla Android from sources!

Thus, we provide the appropriate builder VMs hosted on our faculty's private
cloud during the evens. Unfortunately, we won't be able to offer access outside
the program, but
[you can check our builder VM scripts here](github.com/cs-pub-ro/AOSP-RPI-builder)
if you wish to host your own.

_Embedded Android Summer School was organized with
[Google partnership](https://rsvp.withgoogle.com/events/google-romania-embedded-android-summer-school)
(last edition: 2025)._

Finally, kudos to the [Raspberry Vanilla](https://github.com/raspberry-vanilla/)
project, the AOSP distribution we based our tasks on.
